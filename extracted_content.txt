Key challenges in the current Partner onboarding
1. Inadequate Support for Large Fleet Management
:
Current State
: 80% of EV supply and 40-50% of E-Loader supply is through 3PLs, which will likely increase.3 PL supply has grown by ~3.5 X in 2023-2024 and the trend is likely to continue with Projected MOM growth of 12-15%.In next 2-3 years we are expecting 25-30% our supply will come through 3PL vendors. Currently, In EV categories if we are onboarding 100 vehicles in a month, we receive almost 200-300 requests (2X to 3X of onboarding) to change drivers on a vehicle. Our current systems are optimised for Driver-Owner personas, leading to inefficiencies in managing large fleets where drivers frequently change vehicles. This results in poor experience, revenue loss, low retention, and increased fraud risk.
Key Issues
:
Driver Change Process
: Managing frequent driver changes is cumbersome, with high TAT (1-2 days) and manual workarounds. This causes significant earning loss (e.g., For LCV in July we received 1249 requests for driver change with  1 day TAT and assuming an average earning of Rs 1000 it would have led to ₹12.49 lakhs loss for LCV vendors).
Incomplete driver documentation leads to difficulties in tracking fraudulent activities, as a workaround teams change only the phone numbers of the driver rather than changing all details of the driver or re-onboarding it, which also leads to customers seeing wrong driver information on app
Penalties Misaligned
: SLA penalties are tied to vehicles instead of individual drivers, leading to unfair suspensions and keeping the vehicle operative even if the driver is changed during suspension
2. Ability to Launch Partner onboarding in  New Countries
:
Current State
: Currently in the international markets we onboard partners via Backend office teams and it doesn’t have a provision in the partner app to onboard via app directly, which creates a hindrance in growing supply organically or doing any marketing activities and increases the cost of onboarding. While when the current scale is low teams are able to manage it, however as we grow, lack of this capability can hinder the supply growth and increase the cost of acquisition significantly, along with that it also hampers the brand perception negatively. Currently we onboard Approx 800-900 partners in a month in Bangladesh, this number will go upto 1500 per month by March.In UAE we onboard 250-300 in a month and are yet to start in turkey
Lack of in-app onboarding for international markets forces reliance on FOS channels, increasing acquisition costs and limiting scalability. Expanding app-based onboarding is crucial for growth.
Impact
: Delayed market entry and inefficient scaling of partner acquisition.
3. System Loopholes Enabling Fraud
:
Current State
: The system allows multiple users to register with the same documents creating opportunities for fraud. Along with that there is opportunity to improve the visibility of OCR and document verification API response related information for the SCMS team so that the fraud can be curbed
Recent Incident
:
In ~14000 Orders team flagged the Geo spoofing issue in H1, in majority of these cases partners created multiple driver profiles.
Doc link
A fraud case resulted in over ₹1 crore loss due to 200+ fake partner profiles.
Partners upload the edited/ forged documents with edited details like Number, Photo, Name etc
4. Compliance challenges:
Currently, we store the Aadhar number and images in our database which is not a complaint approach as per the govt, ideally we should store it in the Aadhar vault
Also, these documents are easily accessible
5. High Drop-off Rates in the Onboarding Journey
:
Context:
About 77% of leads drop off between the start of onboarding (owner details page load) and the training start. Specifically, ~50% drop off before submitting owner details, and ~20% drop off at the vehicle details stage.
Dashboard link
.
Owner Details Page
: Approximately 30% of users who drop off are not potential partners (20% are customers, 9% are existing partners). Another 35% drop off due to unavailable documents, while 19% leave the process because they are busy at that moment.
Research doc link
.
Vehicle Details Page
: Analysis shows a ~20% drop-off rate on the vehicle details page, with 26% of these users leaving due to RC-related issues.
Document link
for more details and in dept analysis
Document Management
: Analysis suggests In 63% of rejected cases, the problem was image quality (15% photocopies, 21% blurred images, 8% cropped images). Additionally, 17% of users uploaded someone else’s documents, and 10% submitted the same side of a document twice. These insights will inform improvements to the document upload experience.
Doc with detailed insights
6. High TAT for Partner Onboarding
:
Current State
: While TAT metrics are not currently measurable accurately. Currently, 30-40% of partner supply comes through organic channels, with TAT for task assignment to agents at 12-16 hours(Next day), as the assignment is manual
Performance
: P75 TAT for onboarding is 2 days for 3W, 9 days for 7Ft, and 6 days for 8ft categories.
Document link
7. Tech challenges:
High Lead Time for Changes
:
Underlying Issues
:
Tightly Coupled Systems
: Our architecture is rigid, with highly intertwined systems that slow down any modifications.
Shared Databases
: Multiple teams and services depend on shared databases, leading to bottlenecks and coordination issues.
Architectural Limitations
: The current design constraints make it difficult to implement changes swiftly.(Independent Rollouts and scaling, Multiple domains bundled up and others)
Complex Data Relationships
: Data definitions and relationships are complex, making even small changes time-consuming and error-prone.
Inflexibility in Managing Core Functions
:
Key Problems
:
Role and Relationship Changes
: Changes to roles (e.g., driver-owner, driver-vehicle relationships) are not seamlessly managed, requiring workaround solutions like de-boarding entities.
Increasing Code Complexity
:
Challenges
:
High Cognitive Load
: The complexity of the codebase has grown, increasing the difficulty for developers to work efficiently.
Technical Debt
: Accumulated tech debt makes it harder to maintain and improve the system.
High Bug Susceptibility
:
Problem
: The system's complexity and technical debt have made it more prone to bugs, impacting reliability and user experience.

Ability for the owner to change driver on a vehicle without termination (Decouple Vehicle and Driver as entity)
- This will enable us to build features to enable owners to change driver on vehicle on it’s own
Re-Architecture Needed
- Teams receive a significant number of request every month to change driver on a vehicle
- ~11% of monthly onboarding in Trucks , 13% in ROI, ~13% on 2W and 200%-300% in trucks (EV) are due to driver change requests on vehicle
- Teams either terminate the partner  or change the phone number against the existing partner. termination and  re-onboarding leads to new driver profile creation which then leads to order, suspension and allocation preference history getting lost, which leads to sub par experience for driver partner and customers, and Porter having multiple profiles for the driver. change phone number leas to diver profile issue where the person working on ground and the person whose documents we have are 2 different individuals

- Enable supervisors to be onboarded and get mapped to owners and vehicles
- Supervisors shall be able to manage fleet
Re-Architecture Needed
- In the absence of this features we end up creating duplicate owner profiles in the system, which force us to keep loopholes in the system like allowing multiple users with same documents which then leads to fraud and compliance challenges
- Without building this it would be difficult to ensure that duplicate profiles are not getting created for Vendors
- Zypp (Bike share) has 6 owner account created in Delhi as supervisor persona is not supported currently. overall have ~15 account

Key issue
Lack of support for the large Fleet management use cases :
Almost 80% of the EV supply and 40-50% of E-Loader supply across categories is through 3PL, which will likely continue.Current 3PL (3rd Party vendors) contribute to 10% of LCV supply and the target is to reach 25% by the end of this year. Our current systems are majorly built for the Driver cum owner persona. It is difficult to manage a large fleet on our platform as in case of 3PL drivers on a vehicle change very frequently but our current system doesn’t support it smoothly (we have hacky workarounds) for changing drivers (frequently) on a vehicle, allowing middle layer to manager set of vehicles effectively, penalties are applied on vehicle rather than driver and so on , this leads to poor experience for large fleet owners and earning loss. Leads to poor retentions and unintentional frauds on the platform. Currently, large fleet owners contribute to ~10% of our supply and we expect this to grow by 3X by 2025(
relevant doc for reference
), without solving for them will hinder us for doing business with them efficiently. They shares may also increase with EV mandates coming into picture. Currently
Below are key problems :
High TAT and hacky ways to change driver on a vehicle -
In EV categories if we are onboarding 100 vehicle in month, we receive almost 200-300 requests (2X to 3X of onboarding) to change driver on a vehicle. For them, previously team use to terminate and then re-onboard the same vehicle with new driver now they are changing just the phone number of the driver to enable other driver to start working. usual TAT for this change is approx. 1-2 days. this leads to multiple challenges for 3PL owners as well as Porter
Earning loss to vendor for the duration for which vehicle is not working.
1249 request in LCV received in the month of July. let’s assume average TAT is 1 days and Let’s assume average earning is 1000 then it leads to 12.49 lakhs loss to vendor
Difficulty to track driver in case of fraud -
Since we just have the phone number of the driver and do not have the other documents, it would be difficult to track partners in case of fraud
Data sanity issues -
As porter the the person who is driving the vehicle and the persons whose documents we posses are 2 different persons
SLA Penalties get applied to driver instead of vehicle -
All the suspensions gets carried forward to the new driver, Ex : If the old driver was suspended for 3 days then no other driver can work on the same vehicle until the 3 days are over
Turnaround time to launch a new country :
Currently who do not have Onboarding flow built in on the partner app for the international markets, which leads to we relying mostly on FOS as a channel for partner acquisition and high man-power requirement at the city office for onboarding. Leading to high cost of acquisition. Along with that it would be difficult to scale Partner onboarding capacity only on the basis of 1 channel (FOS).App based onboarding shall help us add more channel of acquisition like Marketing, Organic etc. Solving this challenges is important from the growth standpoint
Below are the no. of Monthly onboarding
Loopholes in the system leading to fraud -
We currently allows multiple users with same documents which leads to potential frauds.
Recently a fraud accrued  where more than 200 fraud partner profiles were created leading to more than a crore loss due to refund frauds. these situations can be avoided with the checks
Drop off in the onboarding Journey -
Document management -
Audited the Rejected documents(Aadhar, PAN, RC,DL) by the SCMS team. In 63% of the cases quality of the image was the issue (Photo copy -15%, Blur image - 21%, Cropped image - 8%), In 17% of the cases users uploaded other persons documents. In 10% of the cases user uploaded the same side of the document twice and missed the one side.These insights shall help us built better document upload experience while revisiting

Owner details page -
Conducted user research to identify why users drop off on the owner details page. Approximately 30% of users who drop off are not potential partners (20% are customers, 9% are existing partners).

Analysed the drop off on the vehicle details page which has ~20% drop-off in the journey. 26% of these users drop-off due to RC related issues.
here is the document

TAT for Partner onboarding is high -
Currently this metrics is not being measured cleanly due to technical challenges and we are finding workaround
Currently ~30-40% of our partner supply comes through the organic channel (Without the help of the city office), All of these leads get assigned to SCMS agent next days for Document verification. TAT for partner assignment is ~12-16 hours
Our P75 TAT for partner onboarding is in 3W is 2 days,7Ft is 9 days,8ft is 6 days
